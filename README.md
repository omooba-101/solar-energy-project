 solar-energy-project
This project presents a mini-grid design for a Rice Mill at 6.731639°N, 6.451333°E requiring 24/7 power. Current supply relies on 1 hour of grid access and a 500 kVA diesel genset. The proposed solution is an interconnected solar-diesel system with peak solar capacity limited to 750 kWp, modeled in PVsyst, HelioScope, AutoCAD, and SketchUp.

Objectives  
- Assess the current energy demand of the Rice Mill.  
- Design a hybrid solar-diesel mini-grid to guarantee 24-hour supply.  
- Use simulation and modeling tools to analyze performance and feasibility.  
- Produce professional engineering outputs (reports, diagrams, models).
  
 Project Components  
 1. PVsyst – Energy Yield Simulation  
- Modeled a 750 kWp solar PV system.  
- Generated monthly/annual energy yield profiles.  
- Analyzed **Performance Ratio (PR), system losses, and capacity factor.  
- Compared alternative inverter configurations.

2. HelioScope – Layout & Shading Analysis  
- Designed array layouts for ground-mounted installations.  
- Conducted shading analysis across different times of the year.  
- Optimized module tilt, azimuth, and string sizing.  
- Produced DC/AC ratio and loss diagrams.

3. AutoCAD – Electrical Drawings  
- Drafted a Single Line Diagram (SLD) of the solar-diesel-grid interconnected system.  
- Illustrated PV array, inverter, transformer, genset, and grid connections.  
- Developed site layout and wiring diagrams with electrical annotations.  
- Exported DWG and PDF drawing sets.

4. SketchUp – 3D Visualization  
- Created a 3D model of the ground mount facility.  
- Integrated ground-mounted solar arrays into the building design.  
- Used shadow analysis to visualize solar access throughout the day/year.  
- Produced photorealistic renders for client-style presentations.
