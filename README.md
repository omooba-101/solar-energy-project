# solar-energy-project
“This project presents a mini-grid design for a Rice Mill at 6.731639°N, 6.451333°E requiring 24/7 power. Current supply relies on 1 hour of grid access and a 500 kVA diesel genset. The proposed solution is an interconnected solar-diesel system with peak solar capacity limited to 750 kWp, modeled in PVsyst, HelioScope, AutoCAD, and SketchUp.”
